## How to Play from Source Code.

Requirements - [LÖVE](www.love2d.org)

Extract/Install LÖVE

Download the latest from the releases.

It should have a square LÖVE logo but if it doesn't,

'Right Click' on 'Revival.love', go to 'Open with', then click 'Choose another app.' 

Then go to 'More apps', scroll down, then click the 'Look for another app on this pc.'

After that just go to LÖVE's root folder and click 'love.exe,' and it should open!
